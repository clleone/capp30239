# US Childcare Access (Placeholder)

Callie Leone

## What is your current goal? Has it changed since the proposal?

I am still working on narrowing my narrative focus. I am interested in exploring
how childcare cost burden and childcare availability affect female labor force
participation for mothers as well as exploring how cost/availability differ
based on population density, common industries, racial demography, etc.

## Are there data challenges you are facing? Are you currently depending on mock data?

I still need to put my point data into a database and parse it into something usable,
but I don't anticipate technical issues on that front. It's just been a matter of
finding the time. Otherwise, my NCDP data is working well, and that's what I used
for these visualizations. I'm hoping to have a few more prepared using the point
data by the time I meet with my critique group.

## Describe each of the provided images with 2-3 sentences to give the context and how it relates to your goal.

Descriptions are available in my static-draft jupyter notebook under experimentation.

## What form do you envision your final narrative taking? (e.g. An article incorporating the images? A poster? An infographic?)

I'm not totally sure at this time, but while I was making the images, I guess
I was envisioning a poster. This is something I think I would like to ask my
critique group about.
