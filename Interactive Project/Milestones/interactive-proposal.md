## Description

{what are you trying to accomplish?}

## Technical Plan re: Option A/B/C/D

I would like to do option A. 

## Mockup

{
At least one image file with a mock-up of what you're considering.
If multiple images help make the intent clear, please include more.
This can be a quick pen & paper sketch of your current idea, or you can use Inkscape/any tool you wish.
A rough sense of what will be shown and how the user will interact with it should be clear from your illustration(s).

## Data Sources

Same data sources.

URL: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/women.s.bureau.department.of.labor/viz/CountyFactsheets/Childcareinthecounties

Size: Variable

The NDCP is the most complete federal resource on childcare cost and burden, with
county level information for 48 states and DC. It is produced by the Women's Bureau
as a subsection of the US Department of Labor. They also have related information
regarding female/maternal labor force participation rates. I could use this data
in combination with Census shapefiles.

### Data Source 2: HIFLD Childcare Centers Point Data

URL: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1w6xOfJ_ptxfDJkChERRs9l9lIeFC-_TY

Size: TBD

HIFLD was unfortunately discontinued at the end of August due to federal government
changes, but someone was able to do a crawl of many of the datasets, including
HIFLD's point datasets on US childcare centers, which is what I have linked to here. 
The datasets here would have been last updated no later than June 26, 2025.
**Saved the files over to my drive per your suggestion.
