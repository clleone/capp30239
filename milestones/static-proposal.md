## Description

I'm interested in analyzing childcare supply and affordability in the US. While 
there is a general consensus on childcare burden and shortage, I think data
visualization could be a useful tool to give more texture to such a complex issue.
Supply and cost constraints likely vary in rural versus urban places or for general
childcare versus specialty care for infants. I've started out here with two data
sets, one that looks at cost, and the other looking at supply, but I think there's 
many different ways I could plug in additional Census data. There's enough 
information to analyze it at both the national and state level. If I can find a
good source, I think data on commutes or levels of state-level childcare regulation
could also be valuable additions.

## Data Sources

{include 2-4 data sources with the following:}

### Data Source 1: National Database of Childcare Prices

URL: https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/women.s.bureau.department.of.labor/viz/CountyFactsheets/Childcareinthecounties

Size: Variable

The NDCP is the most complete federal resource on childcare cost and burden, with
county level information for 48 states and DC. It is produced by the Women's Bureau
as a subsection of the US Department of Labor. They also have related information
regarding female/maternal labor force participation rates. I could use this data
in combination with Census shapefiles.

### Data Source 1: HIFLD Childcare Centers Point Data

Size: TBD

HIFLD was unfortunately discontinued at the end of August due to federal government
changes, but someone was able to do a crawl of many of the datasets, including
HIFLD's point datasets on US childcare centers, which is what I have linked to here. 
The datasets here would have been last updated no later than June 26, 2025.
